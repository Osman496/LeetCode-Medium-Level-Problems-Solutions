# ðŸš€ Explanation:
# Iterate over the string and extract all digits.

# Detect the first - sign before the first number.

# Convert extracted digits into an integer and apply the sign.

# Problem: It failed when multiple numbers were present ("abc123xyz-2" â†’ it wrongly extracted 1232 instead of -2).

# So, we switched to regex, which efficiently finds the first complete signed number without manual character-by-character checking.

    Extracts the first valid signed number from a string.
    - Detects a '-' only if it's directly before a number.
    - Extracts only the first encountered number.
    - Ignores extra characters and misplaced '-'.
