1. Explanation
Understanding the Problem
We need to rearrange a given string into a zigzag pattern with a specified number of rows. After arranging, we read the characters row by row to get the final output string.

2. Approach
Key Observations
The characters move down row by row until they reach the last row.
Then they move diagonally up to the first row and repeat this cycle.
The pattern follows a "V"-shaped movement.
Steps to Implement the Approach
✅ Step 1: Handle edge cases

If numRows == 1, return the string as-is (no zigzag needed).
If numRows >= len(s), return the string as-is.
✅ Step 2: Create a list of empty strings to store characters for each row.

✅ Step 3: Traverse the string character by character:

Keep track of the current row where the character should go.
Use a direction flag to determine whether we are moving down (+1) or moving up (-1).
✅ Step 4: After traversing, concatenate all rows and return the final string.

def convert(s, numRows):
    # Edge Case: If only 1 row or string length is less than rows, return original string
    if numRows == 1 or numRows >= len(s):
        return s

    # Create an array of empty strings for each row
    rows = [""] * numRows  

    # Initialize variables to track row index and direction
    current_row = 0  # Start from the first row
    direction = 1  # 1 means moving down, -1 means moving up

    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for char in s:
        rows[current_row] += char  # Add the character to the current row

        # Change direction at the top and bottom of the zigzag pattern
        if current_row == 0:  # If at the first row, start moving down
            direction = 1
        elif current_row == numRows - 1:  # If at the last row, start moving up
            direction = -1

        # Move to the next row in the correct direction
        current_row += direction  

    # Join all rows to form the final zigzag converted string
    return "".join(rows)

# Example Test Cases
print(convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3))  # Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
print(convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 4))  # Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
print(convert("A", 1))  # Output: "A"
